# 📚 NLP & Text Analysis Collection  
A comprehensive collection of NLP notebooks, data, and scripts exploring advanced and foundational natural language processing tasks.

## 📌 Overview  
This repository contains a curated set of Jupyter notebooks, datasets, and helper scripts that demonstrate and experiment with a wide range of NLP techniques—from basic text processing and topic modeling to sentiment analysis, sequence modeling, and fake news detection. It is ideal for learners, researchers, and practitioners looking for practical NLP examples implemented in Python.

## 🚀 Features  
- **Core NLP Tasks** – Tokenization, POS tagging, Named Entity Recognition (NER), text cleaning, etc.  
- **Topic Modeling** – LDA, NMF, Latent Semantic Analysis examples with real datasets.  
- **Text Classification** – Sentiment analysis, fake news detection, multi-class classifiers with RNNs, XGBoost, and TF-IDF features.  
- **Sequence Models** – Character-level RNNs, LSTMs for text generation and classification.  
- **Explainability** – LIME and SHAP interpretability techniques applied to NLP models.  
- **Data Visualization & EDA** – Visualizing text data distributions, word clouds, and feature importance.  
- **Practical Use Cases** – Amazon reviews, duplicate ads detection, consumer complaint analysis, COVID fake news classification, and more.

## 🛠 How it works  
1. Clone the repo and explore notebooks for different NLP tasks.  
2. Each notebook contains step-by-step code and explanations, ready to run in a Jupyter environment.  
3. Modify or extend notebooks with your own datasets or models.  
4. Helper scripts and datasets are provided for convenience.  
5. Use notebooks to learn methods, experiment with parameters, and build your own NLP pipelines.

## ▶️ Usage  
- Browse notebooks by topic or project.  
- Run and experiment with code interactively.  
- Use helper scripts like `helpers.py` or `project_tests.py` as utilities.  
- Add your own datasets to the `data` folder and update paths in notebooks as needed.  
- Explore visualization and model explanation techniques for better insights.
